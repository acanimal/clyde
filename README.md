# Clyde

Clyde is an open source NodeJS based API gateway.

When developing an API the most important part resides on designing and implementing the business logic and operations. This is true but we know real life projects requires also many other things that can become defiant challenges: logging, authentication, rate limiting, etc.

Clyde allows to concentrate on the implementation of our API business logic, leaving the rest of work to Clyde.

> **Disclaimer !!!**
>
> Clyde is currently a proof of concept. It is unstable and in heavy development process to implement a first core version.
